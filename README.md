# Power Spectrogram (for Neuroscience)
This repository features MATLAB scripts for computing and visualizing Fourier and wavelet transform-based power spectrograms. FT-based methods include `hann_spectrogram.m` and `mtp_spectrogram.m`, which produces a single taper power spectrogram using a Hanning window function and a multitaper power spectrogram that employs discrete prolate spheroidal sequences (DPSS), respectively. `cwt_spectrogram.m` is a WT-based method and performs continuous wavelet transform with a Morlet wavelet in default.
